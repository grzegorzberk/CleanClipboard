# CleanClipboard

CleanClipboard is a macOS application that monitors your clipboard, removes any formatting from the text, and maintains a history of clipboard contents. This project is currently in beta, and I am actively working on adding new features.

## Features

- Maintains a history of clipboard contents
- Allows copying and deleting items from the clipboard history
- Sidebar for displaying clipboard history

## Upcoming Features

- Enhanced clipboard history management
- Adding an icon to the toolbar
- Setting default formatting for clipboard content

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/CleanClipboard.git
    ```

2. Open the project in Xcode:

## Usage

1. Launch the application.
